Send USDC to more than a billion people in the world using your favorite messaging app like Telegram, Discord, Matrix, Slack, Twitter or Whatsapp as easy as

`Pay 10 to Caroline`

**It's that simple!**

## Modern money moves like a message

Fonpay allows you to send money to any person, anywhere, in just seconds, with the unbreakable security of the Ethereum network and the friendliness of your favorite messaging apps. Simply, the way it should be.

## One billion people just one message away

Whether you use Telegram, Discord, Matrix, Riot, Slack, Twitter or Whatsapp –the most used messaging apps in the world by more than a billion people– rest assured your payment will be received in no time protected by cryptography algorithms and the immutability of the blockchain.


## How to use it?

Just search for **Fonpay** bot in your favorite messenger app and type

`register Caroline`

to open your account and start receiving money as easy as

`pay 100 to Caroline`

In order to send payments you need to have funds in your account. You can receive money from friends already using Fonpay or you can fund your account from external sources in two ways: using the USDC account number shown when typing `account` or using the Ethereum address shown when typing `address`

If you use your USDC account like 1000018089 any USDC wallet can send you money directly to your account

If you use your Ethereum address you need to use an Ethereum wallet to send USDC tokens to that address
